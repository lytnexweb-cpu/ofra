# CRM Yanick - MVP++

Real estate CRM system for managing clients, transactions, conditions, and notes. Built for real estate agents to track transaction workflows, manage client relationships, and monitor condition fulfillment.

## Project Overview

**CRM Yanick** is a real estate transaction management system designed for independent agents. It provides comprehensive tools to:

- **Client Management**: Store client information with detailed contact data (address, multiple phone numbers)
- **Transaction Tracking**: Monitor real estate transactions (purchase/sale) with status history and workflow management
- **Condition Management**: Track transaction conditions (inspection, financing, legal, etc.) with priorities, due dates, and completion status
- **Notes & Documentation**: Add timestamped notes to transactions for communication tracking
- **Dashboard**: Real-time overview of active transactions, overdue conditions, and upcoming deadlines
- **Automated Emails**: Automatic email notifications to clients on transaction status changes (offer accepted, deal firm, closing completed)

This is the **MVP++ release** with enhanced client fields, condition categorization, improved UX, and automated client communications.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **React 19** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **TanStack Query** - Data fetching and caching
- **React Router** - Client-side routing

### Backend
- **AdonisJS v6** - TypeScript Node.js framework
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database
- **Lucid ORM** - Database query builder
- **Session-based Authentication** - Cookie-based auth with httpOnly cookies
- **AdonisJS Mail** - Email service with SMTP transport (Brevo/Sendinblue)

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 18+ recommended
- **npm** 8+ or compatible package manager
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for PostgreSQL)
- **SMTP Account** (optional) - Brevo/Sendinblue account for automated emails (free tier available)

## Email Configuration

The CRM includes automated email notifications sent to clients on transaction status changes. Email configuration is required in `backend/.env`:

```env
# Brevo SMTP Configuration (required for automated emails)
SMTP_HOST=smtp-relay.brevo.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-brevo-login@smtp-brevo.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-brevo-api-key
BREVO_API_KEY=your-brevo-api-key

# Email sender information
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=notifications@crm-yanick.local
MAIL_FROM_NAME="CRM Yanick"
```

**To set up Brevo (free tier):**
1. Create account at [brevo.com](https://www.brevo.com)
2. Get your SMTP credentials from Settings → SMTP & API
3. Add credentials to `backend/.env`
4. Emails will be sent automatically on transaction status changes

**Note:** Automated emails are fail-safe - if email sending fails, transaction status changes still succeed.

## Quick Start (Development)

### 1. Start PostgreSQL Database

```powershell
# Start PostgreSQL container
docker compose up -d

# Verify database is running
docker ps
# Expected: crm-yanick-postgres running on port 5432
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```powershell
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run migrations to create database schema
node ace migration:run

# Seed database with development user
node ace db:seed

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

**Backend will be available at:** `http://127.0.0.1:3333`

### 3. Frontend Setup

```powershell
# In a new terminal
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

**Frontend will be available at:** `http://localhost:5173`

### 4. Access Application

- Open browser: `http://localhost:5173`
- Login with dev credentials (see below)

**Note:** Vite automatically proxies `/api` requests to `http://localhost:3333` (no CORS issues in development).

## Database & Migrations

### Running Migrations

```powershell
cd backend
node ace migration:run
```

### Important Migrations

All migrations must be run on a fresh installation. The following migrations configure the database schema:

| Migration | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `create_users_table` | User accounts with hashed passwords |
| `create_clients_table` | Client records with basic contact info |
| `add_address_and_phones_to_clients` | Address fields + homePhone/workPhone/cellPhone |
| `create_transactions_table` | Transaction records with status and pricing |
| `rename_transaction_notes_to_notes_text` | Renamed `notes` column to `notesText` (fixes collision with notes relation) |
| `create_conditions_table` | Condition tracking with due dates |
| `add_type_and_priority_to_conditions` | Type enum (inspection, financing, etc.) + priority enum (low/medium/high) |
| `create_notes_table` | Transaction notes with author tracking |
| `create_transaction_status_histories_table` | Status change audit trail |

### Seed Data

```powershell
cd backend
node ace db:seed
```

Creates development user account (see credentials below).

## Development Credentials

**Email:** `yanick@crm.local`
**Password:** `password123`

Use these credentials to log in to the application in development mode.

### Authentication
- `POST /api/login` - Login (email + password)
- `POST /api/logout` - Logout
- `GET /api/me` - Current user info

### Clients
- `GET /api/clients` - List all clients
- `POST /api/clients` - Create client
- `GET /api/clients/:id` - Get client details
- `PUT /api/clients/:id` - Update client
- `DELETE /api/clients/:id` - Delete client (blocked if has transactions)

### Transactions
- `GET /api/transactions` - List all transactions
- `POST /api/transactions` - Create transaction
- `GET /api/transactions/:id` - Get transaction details
- `PUT /api/transactions/:id` - Update transaction
- `PATCH /api/transactions/:id/status` - Change transaction status (triggers automated email to client)

  ```powershell
  cd backend
  node ace db:seed
  ```
  Then log in again with `yanick@crm.local` / `password123`

### "Database Connection Refused" Error
- **Cause**: PostgreSQL not running
- **Solution**:
  ```powershell
  # Check if Docker container is running
  docker ps

  # Start container if stopped
  docker compose up -d

  # Verify port 5432 is listening
  netstat -ano | findstr :5432
  ```

### "Port Already in Use" Error
- **Backend (port 3333)**:
  ```powershell
  # Find process using port 3333
  netstat -ano | findstr :3333
  # Kill the process (replace PID with actual process ID)
  taskkill /PID <PID> /F
  ```

- **Frontend (port 5173)**:
  - Vite will automatically use next available port (5174, 5175, etc.)
  - Check console output for actual port number

### Build Errors

**Frontend Build:**
```powershell
cd frontend
npm run build
```
- Expected output: `✓ built in X.XXs` with no TypeScript errors

**Backend Build:**
```powershell
cd backend
npm run build
```
- Expected output: `[success] build completed` with no TypeScript errors

### Clear Database and Reset

### MVP++ Part 2: UX & Business Enhancements (December 25, 2025)

**3 Quick Wins for Professional UX:**

#### 1. **Conditions Summary Stats (Reassuring Overview)**
- Added visual summary block above conditions list on Transaction Detail page
- **Displays:**
  - `X / Y completed` - Progress tracker
  - `Overdue: N` - Red badge if overdue conditions exist
  - `Due soon (7d): M` - Yellow badge for upcoming deadlines
  - `Next due: YYYY-MM-DD` - Closest pending deadline (shows "—" if none)
- **Benefits:** Instant visibility on transaction health without scrolling
- **Implementation:** Pure client-side calculation from existing data (no API calls)
- **File:** `frontend/src/pages/TransactionDetailPage.tsx`

#### 2. **Professional Error Handling + Session Management**
- Replaced generic "Network error. Please try again." messages with actionable feedback
- **New Error Utility:** `frontend/src/utils/apiError.ts`
  - Parses 401/419 → "Session expirée. Merci de vous reconnecter." + auto-redirect
  - Parses 422 validation errors → Field-specific error messages
  - Detects network failures → "Impossible de joindre le serveur. Vérifie que le backend tourne (port 3333)."
- **Error Display:** Title + Message + Field Errors (if applicable) + "Go to Login" button on session expiry
- **Applied to:** CreateClientModal, CreateConditionModal, CreateTransactionModal
- **Benefits:** Users know exactly what went wrong and what to do next

#### 3. **Create Client Modal: Tabs for Better UX**
- Replaced long scrolling form with clean 3-tab interface
- **Tabs:**
  - **Infos de base** - firstName, lastName, email, phone, notes
  - **Adresse** - addressLine1, addressLine2, city, provinceState, postalCode
  - **Téléphones** - cellPhone, homePhone, workPhone
- **Benefits:** Logical grouping, less overwhelming, professional appearance
- **Mobile-friendly:** Tabs stack responsively
- **File:** `frontend/src/components/CreateClientModal.tsx`

**Technical Details:**
- **Files Modified:** 5 frontend files
  - `frontend/src/utils/apiError.ts` (NEW)
  - `frontend/src/pages/TransactionDetailPage.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/CreateClientModal.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/CreateConditionModal.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/components/CreateTransactionModal.tsx`
- **No Backend Changes:** Pure frontend improvements
- **No New Dependencies:** Uses existing React/TailwindCSS patterns

**Testing Guide (5 minutes):**

1. **Test Conditions Summary Stats**
   - Navigate to any transaction with conditions (`/transactions/:id`)
   - Verify summary block appears above condition list
   - Check: "X / Y completed", Overdue badge (red), Due soon badge (yellow), Next due date
   - Test edge case: Transaction with 0 conditions (should show 0/0, Next due: —)

2. **Test Error Handling**
   - **Session Expiry:** Stop backend, try creating a client → Should show "Impossible de joindre le serveur..."
   - **Validation Error:** Try creating client without firstName → Should show "Champs requis" + clear message
   - **Field Errors:** If backend returns field-specific errors, they should appear in a list

3. **Test Client Modal Tabs**
   - Click "New Client" → Modal opens with 3 tabs (Infos de base, Adresse, Téléphones)
   - Switch between tabs → Fields persist when switching
   - Fill only basic info → Submit → Client created successfully
   - Open modal again → Tab resets to "Infos de base"

**No Regressions:**
- ✅ Condition deletion still works (ConfirmDialog)
- ✅ Note deletion still works
- ✅ Transaction `notesText` vs `notes[]` relation intact
- ✅ All existing features unchanged

**Build Status:**
- ✅ Frontend: 0 TypeScript errors
- ✅ Backend: 0 TypeScript errors

---

### MVP++ Part 3: Delete Transaction Feature (December 25, 2025)

**Critical Data Management Feature:**

#### Delete Transaction with Cascading Cleanup
- **Problem Solved:** Users couldn't delete test data because client deletion was blocked by existing transactions, and no way to delete transactions existed
- **Solution:** Added secure transaction deletion with automatic cleanup

**Features:**
- **Backend Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/transactions/:id`
  - Multi-tenant security: Verifies `owner_user_id` before deletion
  - Returns 404 if transaction not found or doesn't belong to user
  - Returns 204 No Content on success
- **Automatic Cascades:** Deletes all related data via FK constraints:
  - Conditions (`ON DELETE CASCADE`)
  - Notes (`ON DELETE CASCADE`)
  - Transaction Status Histories (`ON DELETE CASCADE`)
- **Frontend UI:**
  - Red "Delete Transaction" button in transaction detail header
  - ConfirmDialog (danger variant) with clear warning message
  - Loading state during deletion
  - Auto-redirect to `/transactions` list after success
  - Query invalidation: transactions, dashboard, client details

**Use Cases:**
1. **Cleanup Test Data:** Delete test transactions to unblock client deletion
2. **Error Correction:** Remove incorrectly created transactions
3. **Data Management:** Clean up old/unwanted transactions

**Files Modified:**
- **Backend (2 files):**
  - `backend/start/routes.ts` - Added DELETE route
  - `backend/app/controllers/transactions_controller.ts` - Implemented destroy() method
- **Frontend (2 files):**
  - `frontend/src/api/transactions.api.ts` - Added delete() method
  - `frontend/src/pages/TransactionDetailPage.tsx` - Added UI + mutation logic

**Security & Data Integrity:**
- ✅ Multi-tenancy enforced (owner_user_id check)
- ✅ Cascading deletes properly configured in DB migrations
- ✅ ConfirmDialog prevents accidental deletions
- ✅ All related data cleaned up (no orphaned records)

**Testing:**
1. Create transaction with conditions and notes
2. Click "Delete Transaction" → ConfirmDialog appears
3. Confirm → Transaction + all dependencies deleted
4. Client deletion now works (was blocked before)

**Build Status:**
- ✅ Frontend: 0 TypeScript errors
- ✅ Backend: 0 TypeScript errors
