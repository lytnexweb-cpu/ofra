    "general": {
      "q1": "What is Ofra?",
      "a1": "Ofra is a real estate transaction management software designed specifically for New Brunswick agents. It covers the complete workflow from consultation to post-closing, with automated conditions, offer management, and built-in FINTRAC compliance.",
      "q2": "Is Ofra available across Canada?",
      "a2": "Ofra is currently optimized for the New Brunswick market (specific conditions, provincial regulations, FR/EN bilingualism). We plan to expand coverage to other provinces in the future.",
      "q3": "Does Ofra replace my current CRM?",
      "a3": "Ofra is not a generic CRM — it's a transaction tracking tool. It focuses on the workflow of each individual transaction (conditions, offers, documents, steps). It complements your existing CRM rather than replacing it.",
      "q4": "What languages is Ofra available in?",
      "a4": "Ofra is 100% bilingual French and English. You can switch languages with one click from your profile, and the entire interface adapts instantly."
    },
    "trial": {
      "q1": "How does the free trial work?",
      "a1": "You get 30 days free with all Pro plan features. No credit card required to start. At the end of the trial, you choose the plan that fits your practice.",
      "q2": "What happens at the end of the trial?",
      "a2": "After 30 days, you choose a paid plan to continue. Your data and transactions are preserved. If you don't choose a plan, your account remains accessible in read-only mode.",
      "q3": "Can I cancel during the trial?",
      "a3": "Absolutely. You can cancel at any time during the trial with no charges. No credit card is required at signup."
    },
    "features": {
      "q1": "How many transactions can I manage?",
      "a1": "It depends on your plan. Starter allows 3 active transactions, Solo 10, Pro 25, and Agency is unlimited. Archived transactions don't count toward the limit.",
      "q2": "How do automated conditions work?",
      "a2": "When you create a transaction with the property profile filled in, Ofra automatically analyzes the type (residential, condo, land), context (rural, urban), and financing to generate relevant conditions. 52 templates are available.",
      "q3": "Can I customize the workflow?",
      "a3": "The 8-step workflow is standardized to ensure compliance and consistency. However, conditions are fully customizable and you can add manual conditions at any step.",
      "q4": "How does the external offer form work?",
      "a4": "You generate a secure link from a transaction. The collaborating agent fills in the form online with the offer details, and it appears directly in your transaction for review."
    },
    "billing": {
      "q1": "Are prices in Canadian dollars?",
      "a1": "Yes, all displayed prices are in Canadian dollars (CAD). No hidden fees, no surprises.",
      "q2": "Can I change plans?",
      "a2": "Yes, you can upgrade at any time. The change takes effect immediately. To downgrade, you may need to archive active transactions to meet the new limit.",
      "q3": "Is there a long-term contract?",
      "a3": "No. All plans are monthly with no commitment. You can cancel at any time. No cancellation fees, no penalties."
    },
    "security": {
      "q1": "Is my data secure?",
      "a1": "Yes. Ofra uses HTTPS/TLS encryption for all communications, passwords are hashed with bcrypt, and sessions use HTTP-only cookies. Your data is hosted in Canada.",
      "q2": "Is Ofra FINTRAC compliant?",
      "a2": "Ofra integrates FINTRAC compliance tools directly into the workflow: identity verification, funds source confirmation, and complete traceability. The tool facilitates your compliance but does not replace your legal responsibility as an agent.",
      "q3": "Who has access to my transactions?",
      "a3": "By default, only you have access to your transactions. You can share access with specific collaborators with granular permissions (read-only, edit). Agency administrators can have an overview if applicable."
